
*** WIP
- Tags should show a pick list of all available tags, both when writing and when filtering, but also be possible to add new ones
Bugs: Tags selection when filtering overlaps with tags selection when writing + tags filter switches to multiline before it's needed


*** Profile & Settings
- Add authentication, with login (email) and password + the possibility to auth via Gmail
- Number of thoughts per page is parameterized in settings, 10 by default
- Setting for theme (dark/light) should be a flip switch not a list
- Interface language (english, french, ...)

*** UI & Features
- Date picker for both writing and filtering with the possibility to manually write the date (defaults to today when writing)
- App name: Thoughty, with a simple logo of a head daydreaming, with icon and thumbnail and title bar
- Edit / Remove a thought
- If there is a reference to another thought, link it (e.g. "entry (yyyy.mm.dd)" or "entry (yyyy.mm.dd)--X", X being the thought number if there were many in that day)
- Ability to choose a specific page (textbox) in terms of pagination
- Ability to go the first thought of year or year/month
- For date filter only allow/display dates where there is an actual thought, the others should be greyed

*** Tech
- Add a database, the file will be converted to and back from the DB (no more file manipulation)
- DevContainer with Docker for development environment
- Complete README file with details of the app and how to use it
- Complete Mask file with shortucts commands to run the app easily

*** Simple Stats
- Display counts of thoughts per year and month/year with graphs
- Tags stats per periods of time with graphs

*** Converter
- A converter utility that takes the file and transform it for the database
- A reverse converter that would take all the lines in the database and convert them to a text file
- The format of the file both in input and output should be parameterized
- Connect to cloud providers like OneDrive or Google Drive to sync the journal file once converted
- Configure a fixed schedule for syncing the file to cloud (from the DB)

*** File Format
- When there are many thoughts on the same day they should be ass follow ---2--[tags] ---3--[tags] and so on
- Tags are separated by commas but without a space after

*** AI
- Guess the file format for the converter
- Autocomplete tags given the text written
- Fix writing errors and style
- Pass a thought to AI for analysis or further discussion
- Tone and mood of thoughts stats (analyzed by AI)
- Subjects discussed stats (analyzed by AI)
